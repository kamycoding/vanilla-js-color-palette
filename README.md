About The Project
This project is a hands-on demonstration of core web development skills using only native technologies. It allows users to dynamically generate, manage, and copy color palettes. The goal was to create a useful tool while showcasing strong knowledge of DOM manipulation, event handling, and responsive design without relying on any external libraries or frameworks.

This project was built and personalized as part of my front-end development practice.
